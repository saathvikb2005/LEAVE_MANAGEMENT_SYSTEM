# LEAVE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
  The Employee Leave Management System is a web-based full-stack application aimed at streamlining and automating the leave request and approval process for an organization. The system allows employees to submit different types of leave online and monitor their leave status, while administrators get to use features to view, approve, or decline leave requests through a user-friendly interface. The frontend of the app is implemented with Angular, providing a responsive and interactive interface with role-based access for administrators and employees. The backend is implemented with Java Spring Boot, providing secure RESTful APIs to handle users, leave requests, and leave balances. The relational database used to hold user details, leaves, and leave policies is MySQL, holding the data in a structured and efficient way. Key aspects are user authentication and authorizations, management of leave applications, tracking of leave balance, role-specific dashboards, as well as administrative level control of leave rules and employee records. The system accommodates various types of leaves, applies organizational leave policies, and provides real-time updates and transparency. Automating the process of leave workflow, this application saves time, eliminates errors, and overall increases the efficiency in HR management.
